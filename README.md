# DEX Clone - Project Overview:
## Protocol Name: SwappingDream
A simple attempt to try to replicate [Uniswap](https://www.notion.so/Uniswap-2410ddda135480b2a018ffc7a94a5f85?source=copy_link) and it’s core functions, mainly focused on learning the whole protocol, focusing on core Blockchain and DeFi concepts such as:

> 🗒️ Note:As the development goes on, I'll be publishing some pages for each topic above so anyone can follow allong my own studying progress. LET'S BUILD⚙️!
-------------------
Beyond web3 concepts, this project also aims to deepen the understanding of **Smart Contract Development**, getting the most out of the EVM and the [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/) programming languages.
    
[Uniswap](https://www.notion.so/Uniswap-2410ddda135480b2a018ffc7a94a5f85?source=copy_link)  will serve as the backbone for learning and integration, but this project will also be used to explore design choices and to further develop my React skills.
