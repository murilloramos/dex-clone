> üóíÔ∏è Note:As the development goes on, I'll be publishing some pages for each topic above so anyone can follow allong my own studying progress. LET'S BUILD‚öôÔ∏è!

Beyond web3 concepts, this project also aims to deepen the understanding of **Smart Contract Development**, getting the most out of the EVM and the [Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/) programming languages.
    
[Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/)  will serve as the backbone for learning and integration, but this project will also be used to explore design choices and to further develop my React skills.
